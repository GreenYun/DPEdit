# DPEdit 1.0.0
DPEdit is a simple command line utility to accurately set the relative position of monitors in a dual- or multi-monitor setup.

## Usage

Basic command syntax is as follows:
```
dpedit.exe <monitorNum> <xPos> <yPos> [<monitorNum2> <xPos2> <yPos2>] ...
```
~`<monitorNum>` is the index of the monitor to position, where 1 = Main, 2 = Secondary, etc.~

> The original statement is not right. `<monitorNum>` does neither mean the main/secondary/... display nor relate to the number in system Setting app.
> Hence I wrote a program to print all displays with a `<monitorNum>`. See [extra/main.cpp](extra/main.cpp)
> â€” GreenYun

`<xPos>` is the X, or horizontal, position, in pixels, of the top-left corner of monitor `<monitorNum>`.

`<yPos>` is the Y, or vertical, position, in pixels, of the top-left corner of monitor `<monitorNum>`.

NOTE: The main monitor (monitor 1) remains at position {0, 0} at all times. Specifying its location at all is entirely optional.
If its location is set (E.G. on a single-monitor system), the wallpaper will be offset accordingly. However, it will still be at position {0, 0}.

## Examples

> Command Line:
> ```
> dpedit.exe 1 0 0 2 -1920 21
> ```
> Powershell (Windows Terminal):
> ```
> ./dpedit.exe 1 0 0 2 -1920 21
> ```

Moves the main monitor to coords {0, 0} and positions the secondary monitor to the left of
and 21 pixels lower than the main monitor (coords {-1920, 21}).
This example assumes the secondary monitor to be 1080p.


Results in the following monitor configuration:

> ```
> dpedit.exe 2 0 1080
> ```
> Powershell (Windows Terminal):
> ```
> ./dpedit.exe 2 0 1080
> ```

Assuming the main monitor is at coords {0, 0}, positions the secondary monitor below the main monitor (coords {0, 1080}).
This example assumes the primary monitor to be 1080p.


Results in the following monitor configuration:
